Planning to get back to blogging after a 2 month hiatus. I am trying to go through the Fast.ai course again. Chapter 4 is the one that I am finding the most challenging and I intend to work through that again. 

I think I need to write two posts to clear my own thoughts and test my own learning about this. The first part will be about the basic Digit classifier which uses the "idealized" 3 or 7 to check whether a new digit is a 3 or a 7. And the second post will be about how to build a basic DL classifier where the parameters will be tuned by the fast.ai algorithm to improve the accuracy. 

Perhaps writing two more blog posts on the "research projects" suggested in the book on writing your own `Learner` class and building a classifier for all the ten digits of MNIST would be the next blog post assignment. That's my goal. I hope to accomplish these in the next one week.
